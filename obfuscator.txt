fix base64 logic to avoid decoding every short string (ruins readability)

fix renaming map to ensure no variable is referenced before assignment

fix renaming map so that all renamed identifiers are consistent globally

fix AST traversal so that parent nodes are preserved correctly

fix attribute renaming so only user-defined class attributes are renamed

fix handling of dataclass field names

fix handling of Enums (don’t rename member names incorrectly)

fix auto-encoding of strings that break syntax

fix type annotation mutation so they remain valid Python

fix decorator wrapping so original function name is preserved via wraps()

fix indentation output in obfuscated code

fix printing of debug decorator (it uses variables you renamed incorrectly)

fix call to .close() inside exit (name mismatch)

fix renamed variables inside async section (_0x45, _0x43, etc.)

fix list comprehension variables reused outside comprehension

fix renaming of built-in names like range, len, list, dict

fix renaming applied to import names like asyncio, math, random

fix renaming inside with-blocks incorrectly

fix renaming of loop counters used again later

fix handling of return type inside enter (currently illegal)

fix renaming of boolean expressions inside f-strings

fix renaming of function arguments in async code

fix failing rename of class variables (_counter, _0xf)

fix incorrect replacement of literal dict keys

fix invalid renaming in dictionary comprehensions

fix invalid renaming in generator expressions

fix base64 decode expression injection in wrong places

fix renaming of dynamic attributes (getattr, setattr)

ensure f-strings are preserved structurally

ensure renaming never introduces references to undefined variables

ensure exceptions thrown reference the correct error variable

ensure user-defined classes keep consistent mapping across references

ensure lambda expressions keep correct variable scope

ensure async task names refer to correct function names

ensure decorated functions are called with correct renamed parameters

ensure that obfuscation never produces invalid type expressions

ensure AST→source generator preserves valid Python

ensure no renaming breaks context managers or generators

ensure comprehensions still capture correct variables

ensure syntax with yield remains legal

ensure magic constants like "main" remain untouched
